## Configuration

The bot uses the following default configuration:
```python
'asset': 'EURUSD',       # Target asset
'duration': 1,           # Trade duration in minutes
'amount': 1.00,          # Trade amount in USD
'mode': 'PRACTICE'       # PRACTICE or REAL
```

Risk & strategy parameters like EMA periods, RSI thresholds, and max daily loss are customizable within the `__init__()` method.

## How It Works

1. Connects securely to IQ Option.
2. Fetches historical candles and computes technical indicators.
3. Subscribes to real-time candle stream.
4. Continuously checks if trade conditions are met using:
     - Bollinger Band deviations
     - RSI overbought/oversold conditions
     - EMA crossovers
     - Volume confirmation
5. Places call or put trades based on signal strength and risk-reward ratio.
6. Tracks performance and respects trade/risk limits.

## Logging

The bot uses Pythonâ€™s `logging` module to track connection status, trades, and errors. Log messages help monitor performance and debug issues.
